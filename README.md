================

Choir.io supports Salesforce's 8  most popular event types out of the box. But Salesforce is complicated enough that we won’t be able to cater for everything, so we’ve decided to Open Source our Salesforce app to make it easy for people to pick up and customise. 

In this repo you’ll find the full suite of Apex classes, triggers and test cases. 

If you did want to funnel some custom events through to Choir, you should be able to use the [callout code](https://github.com/beachmonks/choir-salesforce/blob/master/src/classes/ChoirCallout.cls#L27) to access Choir.io API
